# elliptic-Curve-Implementation
Implementation of a basic class for Elliptic Curves with addition and scalar multiplication properties. The class can be used for implementing a simple Diffie-Hellman key exchange.



Elliptic Curve Class has its own methods to add 2 points in the curve and do the scaler multiplication. Scaler multiplication is basically nothing but addittion of the same point for several times.
Class does not check whether the generating point is the member of the curve or not. So in different implementations, implementor must be sure about the generator point.

Details and background info added as a pdf file in the repo.
