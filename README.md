# elliptic-Curve-Implementation
The implementation includes a basic class for Elliptic Curves with methods for point addition and scalar multiplication. This class can be utilized for a straightforward implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The class does not verify if the generator point is a member of the curve, so the implementer should ensure its validity in different implementations.
